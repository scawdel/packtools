<chapter title="Introduction" file="Introduction">

<cite>PackTools</cite> are a set of Perl scripts intended for generating RISC&nbsp;OS packages. They are intended primarily for use in a cross-compilation environment.

To use the scripts natively on RISC&nbsp;OS, a copy of Perl&nbsp;5 will be required. At the time of writing, a copy can be found at <link ref="#url http://www.cp15.org/perl/">http://www.cp15.org/perl/</link>. The scripts are command-line based, and should be installed in a library or called by their full pathname.

<chapter title="Command Line Use" file="Use">

The scripts that comprise <cite>PackTools</cite> are <cite>BuildRepo</cite>, <cite>MakeControl</cite> and <cite>GetPackageRev</cite>.

<subhead title="BuildRepo">

<cite>BuildRepo</cite> will scan a directory of packages and build index pages.

It is very tied to the structure of www.stevefryatt.org.uk, and may be of limited use to others. It takes no parameters.


<subhead title="MakeControl">

<cite>MakeControl</cite> takes a template RiscPkg control file and replaces the package version field with a version supplied on the command line.

<command>makecontrol --template &lt;filename&gt;  --control &lt;filename&gt; --version &lt;version&gt;</command>


<subhead title="GetPackageRev">

<cite>GetPackageRev</cite> identifies a revision for a new package, based on the revision of the software to be included in it and any packages already in the target repository.

<command>getpackagerev --package &lt;name&gt; --revision &lt;revision&gt; [--verbose]</command>
